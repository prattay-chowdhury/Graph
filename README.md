# Topological ordergin of Graph

What does the program do?
1. The program will build two given graphs.
2. It will individually show vertices and edges of each graph. 
3. Then the program will print the vertices in DFS and BFS topological order for each graph respectively. It also checks for the presence of cycle.
4. If there is any cycle in a graph, it will not print any order. It wil print that there is a cycle.
5. For DFS final order is stored in an array and for BFS final order is stored in a queue.
